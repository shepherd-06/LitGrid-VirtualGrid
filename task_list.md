1. Data Retrieval from Redis
Batch Retrieve: Use the Redis SCAN command with a match pattern (e.g., electricity_consumption_actual_*) to retrieve all relevant keys for actual electricity consumption.
Fetch Data: For each key, use HGETALL or a similar command to fetch the data. Depending on the size of your data and Redis configuration, consider batching these commands to optimize performance.
2. Data Processing and Analysis
Data Transformation: Convert the raw data from Redis into a suitable format for analysis, such as a pandas DataFrame. This format facilitates easier manipulation and analysis of time-series data.

Trend Analysis: Apply time-series analysis techniques to identify trends over time. You might use rolling averages, exponential smoothing, or other methods to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

Seasonality Detection: Use seasonal decomposition of time series (e.g., using statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose in Python) to extract and analyze seasonal patterns in electricity consumption.

Outlier Detection: Implement algorithms to detect anomalies in the data, which could indicate data issues or unusual consumption patterns. Methods could include statistical thresholding, clustering, or machine learning-based anomaly detection.
3. Summary Statistics
Compute Key Metrics: Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max values to understand the distributions and variability in your data.
Histograms and Distributions: Generate histograms to visualize the frequency distribution of consumption values, helping to identify skewness or bimodality.
4. Storing Analysis Results
Redis Storage: Once the calculations are performed, store the results back in Redis to avoid redundant computations. Use a structured key pattern like consumption_stats:{metric} (e.g., consumption_stats:mean, consumption_stats:std_dev) for easy retrieval.
Hash Structure: Use Redis hashes to store different metrics under each key. For example, HSET consumption_stats:mean 202301 value for the mean consumption of January 2023.
5. Visualization
Time Series Plots: Create plots to visualize the consumption over time, highlighting trends and seasonality.
Anomaly Marking: In your plots, highlight the detected anomalies to make them stand out.

[TODO] Dashboard: Consider developing a dashboard using tools like Plotly Dash or Streamlit to interactively explore the data and results.
